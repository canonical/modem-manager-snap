        Also bump Standards-Version, no change required.
      * debian: update lintian-overrides.
        Due to recent lintian updates, the overrides for `libqmi-glib-doc` are
        no longer needed, while the source package need new overrides: HTML
        files are their own sources, so the `source-is-missing` lintian error is
        not relevant here.
        Moreover, the tag format of the `libqmi-glib5` overrides needs to be
        updated so it can be useful again.

    libqmi (1.30.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  
      * d/control: make -dev package depend on libqrtr-glib
        `libqmi` is now compiled with QRTR support by linking against
        `libqrtr-glib`. However, `libqmi-glib-dev` doesn't depend on
        `libqrtr-glib-dev`, meaning users need to manually add the latter to
        their build dependencies. Avoid this by adding `libqrtr-glib-dev` as a
        dependency to `libqmi-glib-dev`.

      * d/control: build-depend on libqrtr-glib.
        This enables support of QMI over QRTR, required to support Qualcomm SoCs
        in ModemManager.
      * d/libqmi-glib5: update symbols file with new entries.
        Building libqmi with QRTR support adds a few new symbols to the library,
        make sure those are present in the symbols file.
      * d/libqmi-glib-doc: add lintian override.
        Documentation generated by gtk-doc is installed to `/usr/share/gtk-doc`
        as expected. Add a corresponding lintian override, otherwise it will
        complain about docs installed outside `/usr/share/doc`.
      * d/copyright: use secure URL for copyright format.
        Also update copyright information for the `debian/` folder.

        Upstream bumped the required version of `libqmi`, so let's ensure this

        Due to recent changes in `lintian`, our overrides for the -doc packages
        are no longer needed. However, a new `source-is-missing` lintian error
        message must be overridden as it relates to HTML files, which are source
        files themselves.

      * d/control: drop build dependency on libqrtr-glib
        `libqrtr-glib-dev` is now a dependency to `libqmi-glib-dev`, and as such
        can be safely omitted from this package's build deps.
        We must however increase the required `libqmi` version to ensure we
        avoid build failures.

      * New upstream version 1.26.2
      * d/control: avoid duplicate build dependencies and sort list
        `gtk-doc-tools` was added to `Build-Depends` in order to fix build with
        latest autotools, but it was pulled in unconditionally and left in
        `Build-Depends-Indep`. This commit makes sure we avoid duplicates and
        don't need `gtk-doc-tools` when building with the `nodoc` profile.
        We also took the opportunity to sort build dependencies by alphabetical
        order for better readability.
      * d/libmbim-glib4: update symbols file for new version
      * debian: update lintian-overrides.
        Due to a change in how `lintian` reports issues, the `libmbim-glib4`
        overrides were ignored. This commit updates the corresponding file in
        order to fix that and adds a new override for `libmbim-glib-doc`:
        installing documentation to `/usr/share/gtk-doc` instead of
        `/usr/share/doc` is the standard practice for glib/gtk-based software.

        the packages descriptions reflect that.

        This commit addresses multiple issues reported by lintian:
        - doc installed into `/usr/share/gtk-doc` instead of `/usr/share/doc`,
          which is normal behavior for glib-based software
        - missing `Build-Depends-Package` in `libmm-glib0` symbols file
        - ModemManager plugins not including dependency information
        - system-wide `fcc-unlock.d` folder installed even though we don't ship
          any distro-specific configuration which would be included there
      * d/modemmanager.prerm: don't call systemctl directly.
        Debian provides a helper tool for avoiding direct calls to systemctl in
        maintainer scripts, so let's use it.
      * d/control: sort build dependencies.

  * Remove staged packages for libraries already in the core snap
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/modem-manager/+merge/377051
  * Add a phony part that does two things:
    1. Stages packages that get built from the same sources as other parts
       in the snapcraft recipe. For instance, we build modemmanager part
       from the ubuntu sources that are also used to build the modemmanager
       deb package, so we stage said package. This way we make sure that
       when USNs linked to the debian packages appear we get notifications
       from the store.
    2. Second, this part calls a python script that checks that the version
       of the staged deb package is the same as the version used to build
       the related part, and fails if they are not the same. This way,
       whenever we build a new snap, it will fail if we are using an old
       version of the package sources. With this we address the problem that
       might happen if we build a new snap so we stage the latest version of
       the deb packages (whichs gets reflected in manifest.yaml), but we do
       not actually update the sources that we used to build the part. The
       store would not send USNs that actually apply as what it does is
       checking the manifest.yaml file.
