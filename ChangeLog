    libmbim (1.26.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  
      * New upstream version 1.26.2
      * d/control: avoid duplicate build dependencies and sort list
        `gtk-doc-tools` was added to `Build-Depends` in order to fix build with
        latest autotools, but it was pulled in unconditionally and left in
        `Build-Depends-Indep`. This commit makes sure we avoid duplicates and
        don't need `gtk-doc-tools` when building with the `nodoc` profile.
        We also took the opportunity to sort build dependencies by alphabetical
        order for better readability.
      * d/libmbim-glib4: update symbols file for new version
      * debian: update lintian-overrides.
        Due to a change in how `lintian` reports issues, the `libmbim-glib4`
        overrides were ignored. This commit updates the corresponding file in
        order to fix that and adds a new override for `libmbim-glib-doc`:
        installing documentation to `/usr/share/gtk-doc` instead of
        `/usr/share/doc` is the standard practice for glib/gtk-based software.
      * d/rules: drop --fail-missing option for dh_missing.
        This is now the default with dh-compat level 13.

      * New upstream version 1.30.4
      * d/rules: error out if symbols aren't up-to-date.
        We want to ship shared libs with up-to-date symbols file, so having the
        build error out if that's not the case is a good way to ensure we update
        those before releasing the package.

        Update the override so it matches the current format and makes lintian

      [ Cyril Brulebois ]
      * Fix missing dependency on policykit-1 (Closes: #991223).
        Without it, a lot of operations would result in the following error at
        the D-Bus level:
            The name org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1 was not provided by any .service files
        In bullseye, ModemManager.service wouldn't even start, because of the
        missing polkit.service dependency at the systemd level.
  
      [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
      * New upstream version 1.18.4
      * d/copyright: fix wrong path for libqcdm
        `libqcdm` was previously `libwmc`, but the corresponding copyright entry
        wasn't updated when the folder was renamed.
      * d/control: update packages descriptions.
        As it was pointed out, ModemManager now supports 5G modems, make sure
        the packages descriptions reflect that.
      * debian: address lintian issues.
        This commit addresses multiple issues reported by lintian:
        - doc installed into `/usr/share/gtk-doc` instead of `/usr/share/doc`,
          which is normal behavior for glib-based software
        - missing `Build-Depends-Package` in `libmm-glib0` symbols file
        - ModemManager plugins not including dependency information
        - system-wide `fcc-unlock.d` folder installed even though we don't ship
          any distro-specific configuration which would be included there
      * d/modemmanager.prerm: don't call systemctl directly.
        Debian provides a helper tool for avoiding direct calls to systemctl in
        maintainer scripts, so let's use it.
      * d/control: sort build dependencies.
        Also avoid installing unnecessary dependencies when using the `nodoc`
        build profile.

    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/modem-manager/+merge/377051
  * Add a phony part that does two things:
    1. Stages packages that get built from the same sources as other parts
       in the snapcraft recipe. For instance, we build modemmanager part
       from the ubuntu sources that are also used to build the modemmanager
       deb package, so we stage said package. This way we make sure that
       when USNs linked to the debian packages appear we get notifications
       from the store.
    2. Second, this part calls a python script that checks that the version
       of the staged deb package is the same as the version used to build
       the related part, and fails if they are not the same. This way,
       whenever we build a new snap, it will fail if we are using an old
       version of the package sources. With this we address the problem that
       might happen if we build a new snap so we stage the latest version of
       the deb packages (whichs gets reflected in manifest.yaml), but we do
       not actually update the sources that we used to build the part. The
       store would not send USNs that actually apply as what it does is
       checking the manifest.yaml file.
